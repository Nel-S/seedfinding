# Extreme Climates
These are resources related to finding seeds with the largest-magnitude climates possible.<br>
(This somewhat overlaps with my Perlin noise reversal work with [1.18+ far spawns](../Far%20Spawns/1.18+).)

See [the repository's parent README](../README.md) for compilation instructions.

Given the maximum possible Perlin amplitude of &pm;1.0363538112118025, the maximum theoretical climate amplitudes are:
| Climate         | Amplitude               |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Temperature     | &pm;2.30300846935956... |
| Humidity        | &pm;1.75467311951204... |
| Continentalness | &pm;3.79049955607604... |
| Erosion         | &pm;2.50730760777048... |
| Shift           | &pm;2.41815889282753... |
| Weirdness       | &pm;2.96101088917657... |
