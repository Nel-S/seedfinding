# Chunkbiomes

This is a *very limited* port of some of [Chunkbase](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map)'s search filters to standalone [Cubiomes](https://www.github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes)-esque functions. This way, they can be used in programs to check thousands of seeds per second, which is otherwise impossible to do with the website alone.
