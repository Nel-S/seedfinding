# Pybiomes

This is an unfinished, limited port of some of [Cubiomes](https://www.github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes)' features to Python. It is not intended as a "proper" seedfinding tool, since the same program written in C will run incomparably faster compared to if it was written in Python. Instead, this exists
1. as an exercise for myself of porting fixed-width C code to infinite-width Python, and
2. for use by seedfinders who are interested in the field but who aren't familiar with any other programming languages.

Note that in multiple cases, there are syntactical differences between this library and the original Cubiomes library.<br>
One should also not expect this library to remain up-to-date whenever Cubiomes changes.
