Hello. My handle is NelS; thank you for your interest in these works.


## Definitions
In this document, "the works" include, but are not limited to,
- writeups I may or have written, or explanatory messages I may or have sent;
- novel code I may or have created;
- spreadsheets I may or have composed;
- videos I may or have published;
- other novel expressions originating from myself; or 
- similar expressions originating from a contributor, narrowly construed to solely the contributions they have provided to my works.
It does not include third-party libraries such as Cubiomes; elements originating from other parties such as (but again not limited to) Mojang A.B. or Microsoft Corporation; or contributors' works that are unrelated to my works. Any or all of those may have their own terms, which will be distinct from my own.

Similarly, "the results of the works" or "the results" are any ultimate outcomes or facts derived from the works I or any contributors have engaged in. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, discovered seeds and/or coordinates, discovered noise amplitudes, or similar unequivocal facts. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, these are distinct from the works, but also more limited in scope than them.


## Usage Terms
If you would like to use, copy, reference, distribute for free, or build or expand upon the works or the results of the works in a non-commercial manner, you have permission to do so as long as you
1. credit the person(s) who provided the contribution(s) in question in a clear, non-deceptive, and publicly-viewable manner;
2. provide a direct, unaffiliated, non-paywalled, and publicly accessible link(s) to the work(s) involved; and
3. do not engage in any pretense, either implicit or explicit, that you made any discoveries you actually did not; that you provided any contributions you actually did not; that you engaged in any partnerships or collaborations you actually did not; and so on. Be honest.

If you would instead like to
- directly sell the works or results (defined as if someone must, is unduly pressured to, or is deceived into paying money for them in their unaltered or trivially-altered state); or
- republish the works (not necessarily the results since those are just facts) without making any changes or making solely trivial changes (defined as if a reasonable consumer of your derivative would have no or almost no reason to view the original work; this includes react channels);
you do not have permission to do so.

If you would instead like to use the works or the results in a commercial context without directly selling them (such as featuring them in a monetized video), or generally engage in a behavior not listed elsehwere on this document, contact us in a way that all contributors relevant to the requested works can view and participate in the conversation, so we/they can work out any details.


## (Lack of) Warranty and Liability
In all cases, to the extent permitted by United States law, I waive responsibility and shall not be held liable for any claims, damages, false or misinformed beliefs, uses or abuses of the works or results, or other consequences of any kind relating to the works or results. These works are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind whatsoever.

I also do not claim or imply in any way whatsoever these works or results are official Minecraft products; I do not claim that Microsoft or any other organization has endorsed these works or results; and I do not claim that these results are correct or accurate (though I personally have done my best to be thorough).


I reserve the right to modify this license as needed.
